Hot Dog Detection Streamlit App: Silicon Valley-Inspired

Welcome to the "Hot Dog Detection" Streamlit application, inspired by the popular HBO television series, Silicon Valley. This prototype app allows users to upload an image, after which our advanced model will discern whether a hot dog is present or not. We initiated this project with a foundational neural network architecture, and we intend to introduce image augmentation and transfer learning techniques to augment its performance.

The hallmark of this application is its seamless integration with Streamlit, guaranteeing an intuitive and sophisticated user experience, prioritizing user engagement right from the project's inception.

Throughout the development process, we have judiciously utilized TensorFlow's ImageDataGenerator class to efficiently load and preprocess our dataset. As we progress, we will diligently fine-tune and optimize our model to deliver precise results.

Our overarching objective is to demonstrate the substantial enhancements achieved by our model compared to the baseline, offering valuable insights into the efficacy of techniques such as image augmentation and transfer learning. We will persistently archive the most proficient model to a file and seamlessly integrate it into our Streamlit application for users to experience firsthand.
